    Feat/UI ux overhaul final (#667)
    
    * chore: add kls_database.db to .gitignore
    
    * feat: add input prompt icons for keyboard and gamepad
    
    * feat: design BootingSplash with animations and progress indicators
    
    * feat: implement connection state management, improve controller navigation, UI improvements (based on screensize) and implement SavedStateHandle
    
    * Fixing more issues
    
    * fix: resolve compilation errors from merge
    
    - SteamService.kt: remove duplicate imports (Base64, EncryptedAppTicketDao,
      InputStream, OutputStream, TimeUnit)
    - PluviaMain.kt: remove stale ConnectingServersScreen import (class deleted)
    - SteamAppScreen.kt: remove duplicate imports (GPUInformation, Paths),
      remove GameMigrationDialog import/usage (not yet in this branch)
    - SystemMenu.kt: fix SteamFriend event handler types (Unit not SteamFriend?),
      fix LaunchedEffect key parameter
    - LibraryAppScreen.kt: add ContainerUtils import, fix brace structure for
      BoxScope alignment
    - LibraryScreen.kt: fix safePaddingModifier returning Modifier instead of Any
    
    * fix: address regressions flagged by code review bots
    
    - LibraryViewModel: apply currentTab.installedOnly filter to GOG and
      Epic games (was only applied to Steam, breaking INSTALLED tab)
    - LibraryAppScreen: use passed downloadInfo parameter instead of
      hardcoded SteamService call (fixes download progress for non-Steam)
    - LibraryAppScreen: remove old DropdownMenu that was rendering
      simultaneously with new GameOptionsPanel (duplicate menu UI)
    
    * fix: crash on game card entry, bumper nav focus loss, missing search button
    
    - Guard FocusRequester.requestFocus() in AppScreenContent to prevent
      IllegalStateException when PrimaryActionButton is not in composition
      (non-downloading layout uses regular Buttons without the requester)
    - Make library root Box focusable and recapture focus on tab change so
      L1/R1 bumper events keep working when grid has no focusable items
    - Add Search and Add Game buttons to ExpandedLibraryTabBar (were only
      present in CompactLibraryTabBar, invisible on wide-screen devices)
    
    * refactor: remove legacy layout from AppScreenContent, use parallax layout for all states
    
    Remove the dual-layout pattern where a legacy static hero + Button/OutlinedButton
    layout rendered for all states while the new parallax layout only rendered during
    downloads. The parallax Column with integrated PrimaryActionButton action bar now
    renders unconditionally for all game states (idle, downloading, paused, installed).
    
    - Remove legacy hero Box(weight=1f) with static image
    - Remove legacy Button/OutlinedButton action buttons
    - Remove dead statusMessageFlow/timeLeftText variables
    - Remove if(isDownloading) conditional wrapping the parallax layout
    - Revert try-catch on FocusRequester (always in composition now)
    - Clean up ~10 unused imports
    
    * fix: address 13 bot review findings across codebase
    
    - Fix double preLaunchApp call on Success path (PluviaMain.kt)
    - Remove duplicate imports alongside wildcard (SteamAppScreen.kt)
    - Move Compose state mutation off IO dispatcher (SteamAppScreen.kt)
    - Fix TOCTOU race: use captured currentState instead of _state.value (LibraryViewModel.kt)
    - Redact GOG auth code from logs (SettingsGroupInterface.kt)
    - Add @Volatile to pagination vars for thread safety (LibraryViewModel.kt)
    - Add missing GOG/Epic keys to remember block (LibraryListPane.kt)
    - Gate gamepad START button behind enablement checks (LibraryAppScreen.kt)
    - Remove canFocus=false that killed focus animations (LibraryTabBar.kt)
    - Switch SortOption persistence from fragile ordinals to stable string keys (SortOption.kt, PrefManager.kt)
    - Move infinite animations inside AnimatedVisibility scope (BootingSplash.kt)
    - Use LibraryItem.isInstalled instead of stale remember (LibraryGridCard.kt)
    - Uncomment GameMigrationDialog now available in this branch (SteamAppScreen.kt)
    
    * fix: address CodeRabbit nitpicks on LibraryAppScreen
    
    - Extract remember from string template for readability (releaseYear)
    - Remove unnecessary downloadProgress key from sizeText remember
    - Gate GamepadActionBar START callbacks behind enablement checks
    
    * fix: restore downloadProgress as sizeText remember key
    
    DownloadInfo mutates in place so downloadProgress is needed as a trigger
    to recompute byte-based size text during active downloads.
    
    * fix: move button state calculations before key event handler
    
    Variables pauseResumeEnabled and buttonEnabled were used in handleKeyEvent
    lambda but defined after it, causing unresolved reference errors.
    
    * feat: add dismiss button to connection status banner
    
    Users can now dismiss the Steam connection banner to access navigation
    (tabs, settings, GOG/Epic games) when Steam is disconnected. Banner
    reappears when connection state changes.
    
    * fix: prevent banner dismissal reset on config change
    
    Track previous connection state to only reset dismissed flag when
    state actually changes, not on initial composition after rotation.
    
    * feat: enhance download progress UI with pause icon and detailed status messages
    
    * feat: add per-source game counts for library tab badges and update tab labels
    
    * feat: enhance focus handling and gamepad navigation in library screen
    
    * feat: implement grid navigation enhancements with focus handling in library screen
    
    * feat: enhance grid focus handling in library screen for improved navigation
    
    * Address unresolved PR comments (batch 1-2)
    
    * Address additional unresolved review comments
    
    * Address remaining unresolved review comments
    
    * chore: reduce diff noise in PluviaApp formatting
    
    * chore: reduce review noise in PluviaMain and settings interface
    
    * chore: reduce review noise in login viewmodel and debug settings formatting
    
    * chore: reduce review noise in login screen imports and docs
    
    * chore: trim non-functional settings info styling diff
    
    * chore: trim non-functional emulation settings style diff
    
    * chore: align login state and destination annotations with upstream style
    
    * chore: trim non-functional debug settings styling diff
    
    * feat: add carousel layout option for library view
    
    Integrates iPod-style 3D carousel from coverflow branch:
    - Add CAROUSEL to PaneType enum
    - Add LibraryCarouselPane with 3D perspective transforms
    - Add carousel option to LibraryOptionsPanel
    - Conditional rendering in LibraryScreen for carousel vs other layouts
    
    * fix: enable D-pad navigation for carousel view
    
    Add carouselFocusRequester to capture focus when navigating down
    from tab bar, allowing left/right D-pad to scroll carousel items.
    
    * fix: recapture focus when switching between empty tabs
    
    Add currentTab to LaunchedEffect keys so focus gets recaptured
    even when switching from one empty tab to another (e.g. GoG→Epic).
    
    * fix: add focusGroup to connection banner for D-pad navigation
    
    Also attempt (incomplete) fix for L1/R1 bumper navigation when
    switching to empty tabs - focus recapture doesn't persist.
    
    * fix: change theme to dark for proper status/nav bar appearance
    
    Switch from Theme.Material.Light to Theme.Material with transparent
    system bars and dark appearance flags. Status bar and nav bar now
    match the app's dark theme.
    
    * fix: add L1/R1 bumper handling to LibraryTabBar for empty tabs
    
    When focus is on tab bar elements, L1/R1 now correctly switches tabs
    even when the content area is empty (no carousel/list items to focus).
    Also improved focus recapture timing when switching to empty tabs.
    
    * feat(library): add gradient focus borders to tab bar elements
    
    Add rainbow/gradient border styling to tab bar for focus visibility:
    - Tab buttons get gradient border (primary→tertiary) when focused
    - Icon buttons (hamburger, search, add, options) get gradient border
    - Gradient shows on selected tabs too for consistent focus indicator
    - Matches the gradient styling used on game cards in carousel
    
    * feat(carousel): add gradient focus border to centered item
    
    Add matching gradient border styling to carousel's centered card:
    - Purple→tertiary gradient border on centered item
    - 3dp border width with 12dp rounded corners
    - Matches focus styling from tab bar and other layouts
    
    * fix(library): restore focus when System Menu or Options Panel closes
    
    Add automatic focus restoration when overlays are dismissed:
    - Track previous overlay state to detect when they close
    - LaunchedEffect restores focus to carousel/grid after dismiss
    - Fallback onKeyEvent catches unhandled D-pad and restores focus
    - Focus goes to carousel if CAROUSEL layout, grid otherwise
    - D-pad now works immediately after closing menus
    
    * fix(library): preserve scroll position when returning from game detail
    
    Remove LaunchedEffect that was triggering onSearchQuery when returning
    from game detail view. This was causing the entire list to reload and
    reset to the beginning, forcing users to scroll back through chunked
    loading to return to their previous position.
    
    The list still refreshes via:
    - Pull-to-refresh
    - LibraryInstallStatusChanged events
    - CustomGameImagesFetched events
    
    * fix(library): comprehensive focus restoration for all transitions
    
    - Restore focus when returning from game detail view
    - Restore focus after tab change (both empty and populated tabs)
    - Skip focus restoration when search overlay is active
    - Focus goes to carousel/grid content or root for empty tabs
    
    * chore: remove carousel layout (preserved in feat/carousel-layout-preserved)
    
    Remove carousel layout feature for now as it's out of scope for this PR.
    The feature is preserved in the feat/carousel-layout-preserved branch
    for future re-introduction.
    
    Changes:
    - Remove LibraryCarouselPane.kt
    - Remove CAROUSEL from PaneType enum
    - Remove carousel option from LibraryOptionsPanel
    - Simplify focus restoration logic (grid-only)
    
    * fix: grab focus on d pad events on main lib pabe
    
    * fix: ensure L and R change lib tabs regardless of focusable status
    
    * fix: allow game page nav of info elements, align borders with library gradient ui
    
    * Fixed no images showing for non-steam, compatibility/install status/store not showing if no image
    
    * Cleaned up compatibility icons, settings page, allow back button to exit app
    
    * Fixed gamepad action bar not showing
    
    * Fix persona state and online status
    
    * Allow showing game library with signing in to any app.
    
    * Added ability to sign in to any store on app open, fix steam sign in
    
    * Cleaned up login screen
    
    * Cleaned up Steam offline banner, connecting state, moved store login/logout to system menu sidebar
    
    * Fixed annoying dialogs showing
    
    * Added missing translations
    
    * Fixes for Amazon display
    
    * Fixed amazon games count
