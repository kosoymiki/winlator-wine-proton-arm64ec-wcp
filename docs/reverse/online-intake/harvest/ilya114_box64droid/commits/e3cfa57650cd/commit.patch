 Box64Droid is a project with scripts that automate installing preconfigured rootfs with [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64), [Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86), [Wine](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds), [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk), [D8VK](https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk) on Android. Originally was a [fork](https://github.com/Ilya114/Box4Droid) of [Box4Droid](https://github.com/Herick75/Box4Droid) with Box64.

+# Important thing
+
+From December 2024 I stopped developing and from June 2025 (due to ban of main chat) Box64Droid is EOL (end-of-life) due to lack of interest and predominance Winlator and GameHub. Thanks for all who was with me on all stages development and decline of project. We still continue to discuss emulation in a fragment of the [former large chat](https://t.me/x86_64_on_android).
