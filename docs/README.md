# Docs Index

This repository keeps docs in two buckets:

- **Active Ops**: build/runbook docs used by current CI and release process.
- **Research Archive**: deep analysis logs kept for traceability; not authoritative for current mainline behavior.

## Active Ops

- `docs/CI_FAILURE_PLAYBOOK.md` - triage path for failed Wine/Proton workflows.
- `ci/validation/extract-gh-job-failures.sh` - raw GH job log parser to isolate first hard failures.
- `ci/validation/gh-latest-failures.sh` - fetch + parse active failed workflows (latest-run failure only) in one command, with optional TSV/meta export and optional auto run-level triage.
- `ci/validation/gh-mainline-health.sh` - checks latest health state of critical mainline workflows (`fresh + success`) and can export TSV/JSON snapshots.
- `ci/validation/gh-run-root-cause.sh` - run-scoped triage: fetch failed jobs for one run and produce root-cause summaries/artifacts.
- `ci/validation/reverse-compare-gamenative-baseline.sh` - compares built WCP artifact against pinned GameNative Proton 10.4 baseline via reverse contract report.
- `ci/validation/collect-mainline-forensic-snapshot.sh` - one-shot collection of mainline health + active failures + URC check logs/metadata (optional per-run triage + optional online-intake + optional release patch-base bundle capture).
- `ci/validation/prepare-release-patch-base.sh` - local patch-base release gate: runs audits, URC, strict no-fetch intake/high-cycle, and optional Winlator patch-stack preflight / optional patch-base phase cycle into one bundle.
- `ci/validation/run-final-stage-gates.sh` - final pre-push gate runner chaining audits, GN manifest, URC, strict intake/high-cycle, release-prep, and optional snapshot capture.
- `ci/winlator/forensic-adb-runtime-contract.sh` - adb runtime forensic orchestrator for wine/proton scenario matrix.
- `ci/winlator/forensic-adb-harvard-suite.sh` - full device forensic orchestrator (seed/artifacts/matrix/mismatch/per-scenario bundles).
- `ci/winlator/adb-network-source-diagnostics.sh` - device-side source endpoint diagnostics (DNS/proxy/connectivity/curl timings) for VPN/content outages.
- `ci/winlator/adb-container-seed-matrix.sh` - deterministic `xuser-*` clone + `.container` normalization for test matrices.
- `ci/winlator/adb-ensure-artifacts-latest.sh` - refresh/install latest WCP artifacts into app-private contents via `run-as`.
- `ci/winlator/artifact-source-map.json` - pinned source map used by artifact refresh automation.
- `ci/winlator/forensic-runtime-mismatch-matrix.py` - baseline mismatch TSV/MD/JSON generator with status/severity/severity-rank/patch-hint routing.
- `ci/winlator/forensic-runtime-conflict-contour.py` - strict runtime logging contour analyzer for subsystem/component coverage (`AERO_RUNTIME_*`, `AERO_LIBRARY_*`, `RUNTIME_LIBRARY_COMPONENT_*`) from adb scenario captures.
- `ci/winlator/selftest-runtime-mismatch-matrix.sh` - local selftest for mismatch classifier/exit-code contract.
- `docs/ADB_HARVARD_DEVICE_FORENSICS.md` - runbook for end-to-end device forensic suite.
- `ci/reverse/online-intake.sh` - upstream intake with dual transport (`gh` API/no-clone by default, `git` targeted shallow fetch fallback), raw marker parsing, optional commit-scan merge, and autogenerated combined matrix + patch backlog.
- `ci/reverse/run-high-priority-cycle.sh` - strict intake gate for high-signal repos/markers (`GN manifest + backlog strict + optional URC smoke`).
- `ci/reverse/online-commit-scan.sh` - commit-level online scan (GitHub API only) for marker touches across recent upstream commits without cloning repos.
- `ci/reverse/harvest-transfer.sh` - targeted git sparse-harvest + optional local transfer of selected upstream improvements (commit-driven, map-based).
- `ci/reverse/transfer_map.json` - declarative map of what to harvest and where to apply locally.
- `ci/research/reverse-wcp-package.py` - reverse-inspects reference WCP archives (ELF/PE/exports/runtime-class) and can emit full per-file inventory via `--full-inventory`.
- `ci/research/run-gamenative-proton104-reverse.sh` - one-shot wrapper: compares GameNative Proton 10.4 against device Wine 11 or a local path/archive via `WCP_COMPARE_SOURCE`; auto-falls back to common local archive paths when `WCP_SOURCE` is unavailable.
- `docs/GAMENATIVE_PROTON104_WCP_REVERSE.md` - latest reverse report for GameNative Proton 10.4 WCP vs local Wine 11 package.
- `docs/PATCHSET_CONFLICT_REPORT.md` - generated ownership/conflict report for GN patchset.
- `docs/PATCH_STACK_REFLECTIVE_AUDIT.md` - generated overlap/risk report for Winlator patch stack hot files.
- `docs/PATCH_STACK_RUNTIME_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md` - generated runtime-forensics contract report for XServer/Launcher patch coverage.
- `docs/HARVARD_RUNTIME_CONFLICT_BOARD.md` - Trello-style runtime conflict board (done/doing/ready/inbox/checklist) used for multi-agent handoff and incremental task intake.
- `ci/winlator/validate-patch-sequence.sh` - enforces contiguous `NNNN-` patch numbering before audits/build.
- `ci/winlator/check-patch-stack.sh` - clean-clone patch-stack apply-check used for local drift detection and Winlator CI preflight; also supports `WINLATOR_PATCH_FROM/TO` for scoped full-audit windows.
- `ci/winlator/check-patch-batches.sh` - lighter local patch-base runner that applies the stack one patch at a time or in configurable 5-7 patch batches; it can also target one named phase directly.
- `ci/winlator/run-patch-base-cycle.sh` - phase-oriented local patch-base runner that applies named contiguous windows (`foundation`..`contracts_finish`) using `standard`/`wide`/`single` batch profiles.
- `ci/winlator/list-patch-phases.sh` - prints the named phase windows from `ci/winlator/patch-batch-plan.tsv`.
- `ci/winlator/resolve-patch-phase.sh` - resolves one named phase into `first/last/note` so local patch tools can consume it.
- `ci/winlator/list-patch-batches.sh` - prints the exact patch windows for `single`/`standard`/`wide` local bring-up before running any clone/apply step.
- `ci/winlator/next-patch-batch.sh` - prints the next batch window after a given patch cursor so local patch-base work can advance without manual index math.
- `ci/winlator/next-patch-number.sh` - prints the next safe contiguous `NNNN` patch number (and an optional suggested filename) without creating a placeholder patch.
- `ci/winlator/ci-build-winlator-ludashi.sh` - Winlator APK build entrypoint; runs upstream inspect, patch-stack preflight, patch apply, and Gradle build.
- `docs/UNIFIED_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md` - runtime contract for WCP packaging.
- `docs/EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_CONTRACT.md` - arbitration contract for external runtime signal sources (GN/GH/Termux lanes).
- `docs/X11_TERMUX_COMPAT_CONTRACT.md` - optional `termux_compat` backend contract (preflight/env/forensics).
- `docs/CONTENT_PACKAGES_ARCHITECTURE.md` - content package model used by Winlator UI.
- `docs/CONTENTS_QA_CHECKLIST.md` - QA checklist for contents/adrenotools paths.

## Patch Pipeline Docs

- `ci/gamenative/README.md` - GN patchset structure and actions.
- `ci/gamenative/PATCHSET_PIPELINE.md` - mode semantics (`full`, `normalize-only`, `off`).
- `ci/gamenative/check-manifest-contract.py` - validates GN patchset manifest schema, required rows, and critical action contracts.
- `ci/gamenative/patchset-conflict-audit.py` - report generator used to detect duplicate ownership.

## Research Archive (reference only)

The files below are preserved as historical analysis and can be used for forensic comparison:

- `docs/REFLECTIVE_HARVARD_LEDGER.md`
- `docs/AEROSO_IMPLEMENTATION_REFLECTIVE_LOG.md`
- `docs/UPSCALER_TRANSFER_REFLECTIVE_LOG.md`
- `docs/COMMIT_PROGRESS_0a-9z_JOURNAL.md`
- `docs/GAMEHUB_PROVENANCE_REPORT.md`
- `docs/GAMENATIVE_BRANCH_AUDIT_LOG.md`
- `docs/GAMENATIVE_PROTON_10_4_WCP_BASELINE_ANALYSIS.md`
- `docs/GAMENATIVE_PROTON104_WCP_REVERSE.json`

When an archived finding becomes actionable, migrate the result into an Active Ops doc and keep archive files immutable.
